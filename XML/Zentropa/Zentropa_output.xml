    All of the best men I know, the good men who are good at being men, just want to be left alone.
    The best men I know believe in individual freedom. They don’t want to control other people. The
    best men in America and throughout the world want to be able to do what they want, and they want
    other people to be able to do what they want with their own bodies and resources. They don’t
    want to be forced to do or say things they don’t think are right, and they don’t want to force
    other people to do or say things that they don’t think are right. These men understand the need
    for some consensus to maintain law and order and the protection of individual rights and
    property, but they are fundamentally anti-"fascist" and anti-totalitarian. For the most part,
    they want to mind their own business, and they want to limit the power of the state. They want
    the state to pave the roads, protect property, provide basic services, and then mind its own
    business and stay out of people’s personal and professional lives. Though the name is tainted,
    these are "liberal" values. Americans led the way in opposing authoritarian regimes that ruled
    them from far away. They understood that freedom is not anarchy but localized
    self-determination. They believed in the right of small groups to determine for themselves how
    they wanted to live. I’ve always believed that the people of San Francisco or Portland or
    Seattle have no business telling people in Alabama or even the small towns a hundred miles away
    from them what to do or how to live. And vice versa. Frankly, I don’t think the people in
    Alabama or small towns across America care how people in San Francisco or Portland or Seattle
    live. They may mock them, but they are content to let San Franciscans be San Franciscans, as
    long as San Franciscans mind their own business and leave them alone. Unfortunately, if the
    events of the year 2020 have or should have taught us anything, it is that this belief will not
    be reciprocated. Just as the conservatives of old seemed to have been kept up at night by the
    idea that someone, somewhere was having some kind of unapproved fun, the progressives in cities
    seem to be perpetually incensed by the thought that somewhere, the people they hate who live in
    the "backward" places they never go to are failing to worship and affirm their own sacred cows.
    These urban "progressives" want to force people who they don’t know (or even like) to do and say
    and profess the things that urban progressives believe — whether those country barbarians like
    it or not. They are tyrants, motivated by a culture of resentment against the values held by
    people who live in the places that, in many cases, they abandoned for big city life. These
    tyrants believe that they are better educated and qualified to tell everyone else what they
    should believe and how they should live. They share a constantly evolving utopian vision, and
    like the communists and fascists of the 20th Century, they’re not going to just "leave you
    alone." Their feel-good mottos proclaim that "no one is free until everyone is free," but what
    they really mean is that they won’t stop until everyone agrees with them, submits to their
    self-proclaimed authority, and acknowledges the expertise of their experts. That you won’t be
    free until you agree. And if you have to agree to be free, then you were never really free at
    all. #So many of the best men I know share a similar fantasy. They want to move to the country,
    or to "a little cabin in the middle of nowhere." They want to escape to somewhere where they can
    be free, where they can be left alone. A lot of people assumed that when I wrote Becoming a
    Barbarian, I was telling them to go live off-grid in the wilderness somewhere. Many thought that
    I was doing that at Waldgang, though that was never the case. Actually, in Becoming a Barbarian,
    I wrote: </text>
  <text date="01.13.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="694"> "There are no more New Worlds, no
    readily habitable and fertile uncharted lands to discover. The reach of commercialism and its
    universalist monoculture is always expanding, even into unstable and untamed zones like Africa
    or Afghanistan, and it will keep expanding until there is a Mcdonald's in every Mosque and the
    world’s most volatile religion is moderated into another meaningless consumer identity. You
    could spend all of your resources and the best years of your life trying to fuck off to some
    rugged oasis, only to find a few years later that Globocorp will be bulldozing your Eden to make
    room for chain stores and condominiums."Last year, when the "pandemic" hit, I thought I’d be
    safe from the worst restrictions because I lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere. And
    we were "free(er)" there. At times. But not much. The Empire of Nothing reached out from the
    cities and imposed its rule in small places, too. In towns where the virus never made an impact,
    small businesses were still forced to close and livelihoods were destroyed. I believe that this
    was done purposefully and maliciously. The places that resisted were punished with restrictions
    that had no relationship to the presence of the virus, and if a rationale for the restrictions
    was needed, "experts" were sent out to "model" a reason why it was a far bigger threat in the
    area than it ever was. I finally left Oregon and moved to Utah. Many argue that the two major
    political parties are the same. That may be true among the major players in DC, but it was
    undeniable that cities in "red" states were far freer than even tiny towns in "blue" states. I
    recently drove through Goldendale, Washington, and watched a father who owned a small restaurant
    look sadly out the door of his closed restaurant, hoping for a "to go" order. His
    family-operated restaurant used to be packed every Sunday, and it was the best place to eat in
    town. He had been making a decent living and living free in a small town in the middle of
    nowhere, four or five hours from Seattle or Olympia. I’m sure he wanted nothing to do with those
    cities or the people in them. I doubt his business will survive this year. It was sad to see and
    a terrible injustice. Goldendale, Washington is full of preppers and farmers and people living
    off-grid. I’m sure some of them are doing fine. But their community is being controlled, and
    their businesses are being destroyed by people hundreds of miles away, who don’t care if they
    live or die or are forced into bankruptcy. They might as well be colonies, ruled by foreign
    kings. You can move to a small town in the middle of nowhere and live off-grid if you want to,
    but the Empire of Nothing has made it clear that they’re not going to leave you alone. In the
    long term, there’s nowhere to run. Even now, they’re controlling the technology that you use to
    communicate with each other and the outside world. You can find workarounds, but these
    workarounds are all temporary fixes. The Empire of Nothing demands compliance and conformity. As
    I also wrote in Becoming a Barbarian… "The conquering narrative of the Empire of Nothing is a
    narrative of total unity. In exchange for accepting the narrative, the Empire offers a
    comforting, multicultural hospice as you pass into the void."I have variously identified as a
    "heathen" and a "pagan." While these words are associated with belief systems, they were
    originally used as a pejorative insult for resistant country people who refused to conform to
    the mainstream beliefs of previous cosmopolitan empires. The people who attempt to practice the
    religions of ancient heathens and pagans today are called "neopagans" because their belief
    systems have been dead for over a thousand years. The practices of "Heathens" and "Pagans"
    didn’t survive. Do you really want to take a cue from them and become resistant country people?
    It’s not a winning strategy. #A lot of the men who want to escape to a cabin in the middle of
    nowhere idealize Thoreau’s Walden. </text>
  <text date="01.13.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="732"> While the cabin is out there, far from
    everything and almost everyone, it represents a passage inward—a quieting of the mind, of the
    din, of other voices. Life in the cabin is a meditation. Parts of Walden itself read like a
    mindfulness meditation script. When Thoreau muses on the songs of the whip-poor-wills or the
    sounds of passing trains, he is slowing down and paying attention. As social animals, we are
    continually reacting to the words and actions of other men and women, directing our attention
    outward. By tuning out other people and tuning into the simple sounds and sensations of being
    creatures who are alive in the world, we naturally turn our attention inward, and the faculties
    we use to assess others can be employed to analyze and better understand ourselves. This is a
    worthwhile exercise, and worth doing as an exercise — as a retreat, because it is a retreat not
    to, but from a man’s life. Too often, men hide from life by seeking purity in nature, like the
    Saint in Zarathustra who believes that he lives "a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds."
    However, the Saint is neither a bear nor a bird, he is a man, and to be a man is to be a man
    among men. Is being a man any less "pure" than being a bird or a bear? In a character study,
    Robert Louis Stevenson roasted Thoreau and called him a "skulker" who was "cruel in the pursuit
    of goodness," and "morbid in the pursuit of health." "…Thoreau’s content and ecstasy in living
    was, we may say, like a plant that he had watered and tended with womanish solicitude; for there
    is apt to be something unmanly, something almost dastardly, in a life that does not move with
    dash and freedom, and that fears the bracing contact of the world."When men talk about retiring
    to their little cabin in the middle of nowhere, I wonder, "What are you going to DO there?" "Are
    you going there to DIE?" Many forget that Thoreau only stayed in the cabin for a few years. He
    wrote, "I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I
    had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one."By all means,
    plan a retreat to a little cabin in the middle of nowhere. Some time spent alone chopping wood
    and listening to the whip-poor-wills is probably going to be good for the soul. But it’s not a
    long term strategy. Because, as I’ve said, even there, they’re not going to leave you alone. #A
    lot of the best men I know have escaped to the country, or they want to. However, in leaving the
    cities, we leave the centers of power and finance and culture creation and the media to others.
    You left the power and the money and the control of culture and the dissemination of information
    in the hands of the worst men and women. What did you think was going to happen?We’ve allowed
    ourselves to be governed by people who hate us and whose values — to the extent that they even
    have values — are completely incompatible with our own. Over several generations, we’ve
    willingly given up the reigns of our chariots and abandoned the natural work of men — to create
    order and culture. What did you think was going to happen?Too many of my readers have accepted
    cyclical models of history that conveniently absolve them of agency. It is much easier to
    believe that we are in some pre-ordained "bad time," some kali yuga or dark age. While cultures
    certainly move through cycles, these models were developed in relatively finite communities.
    Taking a broader view, we can see that one culture may be going through a golden age while
    another is experiencing an internal collapse.Things were bad enough 200 years ago that Americans
    fought a war for independence and self-determination. Were they in the kali yuga, too? If so,
    what would you call the last 200 years? Were the men who fought in the wars 200 years prior and
    200 years before that also in a dark age? Men of every age have experienced hardships and
    dissolution, but it is and has always been the responsibility of men to create order in the
    midst of chaos. </text>

    principe et la finalité de la consommation n’est pas la jouissance est que celle-ci est
    aujourd’hui contrainte et institutionnalisée non pas comme droit ou comme plaisir mais
    comme devoir du citoyen.Le puritain se considérait lui-même, considérait sa propre personne
    comme une entreprise à faire fructifier pour la plus grande gloire de Dieu. Ses qualités
    "personnelles", son "caractère", à la production desquels il passait sa vie, étaient pour lui un
    capital à investir opportunément, à gérer sans spéculation ni gaspillage.A l’inverse, mais de la
    même façon, l’homme-consommateur se considère commedevant-jouir, comme une entreprise de
    jouissance et de satisfaction. Comme devant-être-heureux, amoureux, adulant/adulé,
    séduisant/séduit, participant, euphorique et dynamique.C’est le principe de maximisation de
    l’existence par multiplication de signes, d’objets, par l’exploitation systématique de toutes
    les virtualités de jouissance.Il n’est pas question pour le consommateur, pour le citoyen
    moderne, de se dérober à cette contrainte de bonheur et de jouissance, qui estl’équivalent dans
    la nouvelle éthique de la contrainte traditionnelle de travail et de production. L’homme moderne
    passe de moins en moins de sa vie à la production dans le travail mais de plus en plus à
    la production et innovation continuelle de ses propres besoins et de son bien être. Il
    doitveiller à mobiliser constamment toutes ses virtualités, toutes ses capacités consommatives.
    S’il l’oublie, on lui rappelera gentiment et instamment qu’il n’a pas le droit de ne pas être
    heureux. Il n’est donc pas vrai qu’il soit passif: c’est une activité continuelle qu’il déploie,
    qu’il doit déployer. Sinon, il courrait le risque de se contenter de ce qu’il a et de devenir
    asocial.D’où la reviviscence d’une curiosité universelle (concept à explorer) en matière de
    cuisine, de culture, de science, de religion,de sexualité, etc. "Try Jesus!" dit un slogan
    américain. "Essayez donc (avec) Jésus!". Il faut tout essayer: car l’homme de la consommation
    est hanté par la peur de "rater" quelque chose, une jouissance quelel qu’elle soit. On ne sait
    jamais si tel ou tel contact, telle ou telle expérience (Noël aux Canaries, l’anguille au
    whisky, le Prado, le LSD, l’amour à la japonaise…) ne tirera pas de vous une "sensation".Ce
    n’est plus le désir, ni même le"goût" ou l’inclination spécifique qui sont en jeu, c’est une
    curiosité généralisée mue par une hantise diffuse - c’est la "fun-morality", où l’impératif de
    s’amuser, d’exploiter à fond toutes les possibilités de se faire vibrer, ,jouir ou

  <text date="01.14.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="139"> Le super-héros n’est pas un héros à
    l’exponentielle, mais le contraire même du héros. Le héros est une figure tragique. C’est un
    homme qui a choisi d’avoir une vie glorieuse mais brève, plutôt qu’une vie confortable mais
    quelconque. Le héros est un homme qui sait qu’un jour ou l’autre, il devra donner sa vie. Rien
    de tel chez Iron Man, Superman, Spiderman et autres tristes productions de chez DC ou Marvel. Ce
    ne sont pas des héros parce qu’ils sont invincibles, qu’ils ne ressentent pas la moindre peur,
    qu’il n’y a rien de tragique en eux. Ce ne sont des surhommes que sous l’angle de la
    testostérone. Au sens propre, ce sont des " hommes augmentés ", tels que se les représentent les
    tenants du " surhumanisme ". On est à mille lieues d’Achille ou de Siegfried.Alain de Benoist </text>

    que la noblesse n'était pas seulement liée à la naissance, mais aussi au mérite, ce qui

    sont dépendants de leurs représentations, de leurs idées, même incertaines, mêmes inconscientes.
    Aussi n’est-il pas faux de prétendre que les idées mènent le monde, quelle que soit la cause de
    leur formation. En dépit des apparences, les actions humaines ne sont pas déterminées par
    l’utilitaire, mais par des systèmes de valeurs en conflit. Et toujours se posera l’obligation de
    gagner la bataille des idées ou d’être terrassé dans sa substance même.Dominique Venner,

  <text date="01.14.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="72"> We are needy creatures, and our greatest
    need is for home - the place where we are, where we find protection and love. We achieve this
    home through representations of our own belonging, not alone but in conjunction with others. All

    attempts to extend a welcome to ourselves and to those whom we love.- Sir Roger Scruton </text>

    les ambitions territoriales de l’empire autrichien, à qui elle succombe plusieurs fois. Les
    ruelles de la ville voient débarquer des nuées de soldats autrichiens, accompagnés de marchands,
    diplomates, fonctionnaires venus de Vienne et d’ailleurs. Dans les tavernes de la Vénétie, ils
    sont rebutés par le taux d’alcool des vins de la région, plus élevés que les breuvages auxquels
    ils sont habitués. Naît alors la tradition de demander au serveur "d’arroser", "d’asperger"
    d’eau la vinasse. Et c’est de ce geste, spritzen en allemand, qu’est né le " spritz ". Le Spritz

    and emasculate them. Apocalyptic fantasies are a particularly male preoccupation. More and more

    with gloss dust jacket.Pre-release special first edition. Signed. From the dust jacket:"Men
    today have the ability to read and be inspired by masculine myths and stories from all of the
    world’s religions. We can see how they evolved from one to another. Still, so many men find
    themselves searching for some sense of what is sacred and want to connect to something eternal,
    something greater than themselves. The question is: with so many choices, so many traditions, so
    many gods and heroes — which ones? In Fire in the Dark, author Jack Donovan — best known for his
    underground classic, The Way of Men — explores the common themes in these myths that are still
    relevant to the lives of men today. Beginning with the simple, primal metaphor of the campfire,
    Donovan identifies a tripartite system of masculine roles and shows how those roles have been
    repeated again and again throughout the history of myth and religion. It is the nature of men to
    create order from chaos, and when order has been created, it is the work of men to protect and
    perpetuate that order. These jobs have been idealized in world-ordering sky fathers and
    thundering warriors and fertility gods. Donovan has integrated these ideals into a natural
    religion for men that is not new, but actually draws from the very oldest ideas about what it
    means to be a man." </text>

    proprio manuale del rivoluzionario: per molti, ancora oggi, rappresenta il "Che fare?" della
    galassia identitaria. Dominique Venner lo scrisse in carcere, con il preciso intento di offrire
    una strategia operativa ai tanti militanti francesi che credevano nella svolta nazionalista
    europea: un’opera essenziale e completa, scritta con il linguaggio asciutto e diretto di chi si
    è formato nell’attivismo di strada e nella guerra d’Algeria.Nel testo, impreziosito dal saggio
    introduttivo di Maurizio Rossi, l’analisi storica si mescola alla lucidità pragmatica: sono
    passate in rassegna tutte le esperienze rivoluzionarie della storia, al fine di elaborare
    un’efficace teoria della lotta e una nuova coscienza del soldato politico.I riferimenti sono
    netti e qualificanti: il richiamo alla disciplina e alla tenuta interiore, la centralità della
    Formazione e della dottrina ideologica, l’urgenza di costruire un’organizzazione strutturata ed
    efficiente, la volontà di edificare una Comunità organica di popolo. Orientamenti profondi e
    ancora attualissimi, che indagano e colpiscono le manchevolezze di un’area "nazionale"
    impreparata e improvvisata: il rischio del tribalismo e della frammentazione, l’assenza di Capi
    e di regole, il persistere di atteggiamenti caricaturali e di miti incapacitanti, la cedevolezza
    dinanzi alle lusinghe e alla repressione del sistema.Venner suggerisce una Via, oltre la palude
    delle illusioni democratiche, dei dogmi progressisti e delle tentazioni liberal-capitaliste: il
    riscatto della Civiltà europea, forte di un umanesimo virile, di un ordine millenario e di una
    terribile volontà di riconquista. </text>

    voir la maîtresse " lorsqu’ils sont victimes de coups ou d’agressions, pas assez à se défendre
    eux-mêmes ou, au minimum, à faire face à une situation de conflit. Pas intellectuellement, mais
    physiquement, avec leurs instincts. Le courage n’est pas une construction intellectuelle et ne
    se forge pas avec des mots mais avec l’expérience directe, physique, instinctive de la vie, des
    difficultés et de la souffrance physique. La culture des normes et de la résolution pacifique du
    conflit, voire du conflit comme " échec ", est une tendance lourde et particulièrement
    pernicieuse dans nos sociétés, en particulier pour les instincts virils. Ce travail de formatage
    des institutions publiques, qui invite les enfants et les citoyens à s’en remettre à
    l’institution dans la gestion des conflits tout en sachant parfaitement que ces institutions ne
    remplissent pas ce rôle et ne le pourront jamais, est une catastrophe sur le plan éducatif et
    ses impacts sur la population autochtone particulièrement lourds. La prépondérance des valeurs
    maternelles qui doivent savoir progressivement se placer en retrait à partir de quatre ou cinq
    ans dans l’éducation du jeune garçon et le manque de présence des valeurs de pères viennent
    renforcer à chaque instant ces tendances.La culture de l’honneur individuel et familial doit
    précéder la culture de la norme sociale de la collectivité politique. Les instincts de défense
    ne doivent pas être inhibés par un matraquage moral maternant ou par une culture de la
    légitimité supposée des corps de l’Etat dans l’exercice de la violence légitime. Et ce pour une
    raison simple : il n’assure pas correctement cette mission et ne l’assurera jamais. Le respect
    des règles deviendra plus tard un prétexte à son manque d’esprit de défense, d’initiative, de
    révolte. Loin de toute culture suprémaciste (" nous sommes les meilleurs ") aux effets
    accablants lorsqu’on ne domine pas un rapport de forces, apprenez-lui aussi à perdre et
    donnez-lui l’envie de recommencer et de gagner. Faites comprendre à votre garçon que ce qui est
    honteux ce n’est pas de perdre une bataille, un moment de conflit, mais de s’y dérober par
    lâcheté. Que perdre c’est parfois triste mais c’est honorable, en tout cas plus que de se
    soumettre. Revaloriser et soutenir son enfant, y compris dans ses manifestations d’agressivité
    (parfois inadéquates), c’est légitimer son agressivité naturelle et l’aider à gérer le conflit
    par ses propres moyens. Ne pas lui apprendre à chercher le soutien des adultes et de
    l’institution, qui dans l’immense majorité des cas ne le protégera pas lorsqu’il en aura besoin.
    Cet aspect de l’éducation des jeunes garçons est fondamental.Quelques exemples pratiques ? Ne
    relevez pas un enfant en bas âge lorsqu’il tombe mais encouragez-le à se relever seul jusqu’à ce
    qu’il réussisse et félicitez-le lorsque c’est fait, par des mots ou un geste de tendresse. Ne
    grondez pas votre enfant s’il manifeste de l’agressivité ou de la violence raisonnable dans une
    relation avec d’autres enfants, n’intervenez que s’il y a un réel risque et de façon non morale
    mais disciplinaire. Apprenez, certes, à votre enfant l’existence des normes collectives mais
    sans jamais oublier de lui rappeler la première de toutes les normes : la survie et la capacité
    de se faire respecter et de se défendre. Valorisez cela à chaque fois que nécessaire.La capacité
    d’un garçon à exprimer ses préférences, à exprimer son agressivité, à régler les conflits par
    lui-même, sans chercher un appui, est une condition indispensable à sa construction virile. L’en
    priver c’est l’exposer, l’affaiblir, le mettre en danger. Si vous espérez un jour pouvoir
    compter sur son aide et sa force, c’est donc vous mettre en danger, vous aussi.Laurent Ozon </text>

    RISTORATORI A Firenze e Siena sostegno per i ristoratori: "NO ai fantasmi delle multinazionali,
    SI alla tradizione dei nostri ristoranti".Una scenografica azione quella realizzata a Firenze e
    Siena per sostenere la categoria dei ristoratori e in particolare la protesta di coloro che
    hanno deciso di restare aperti per cena durante questo fine settimana. A compierla le
    associazioni "Firenze Identitaria" e "Il Selvaggio Siena", che hanno realizzato e appeso dei
    veri e propri fantasmi nelle rispettive città, apponendo anche dei cartelli con scritto
    "Delivery food – Ghost Kitchen, NO ai fantasmi delle multinazionali, SI alla tradizione dei
    nostri ristoranti"."Sostenere le rivendicazioni dei ristoratori significa difendere l’economia
    locale e quindi la ricchezza del nostro territorio – dichiarano congiuntamente i responsabili
    delle associazioni – in molti non lo hanno capito, ma è in corso un vero e proprio attacco al
    nostro tessuto socioeconomico. Come detto dal Forum Economico Mondiale, il virus si è
    trasformato in un’occasione per favorire logiche globaliste, ovviamente a discapito di tutto ciò
    che è prossimità.""Dallo scorso marzo - continua la nota – la ristorazione italiana viene
    vessata con promesse mai mantenute, totale assenza di sostegni concreti e norme repressive che
    causano innumerevoli chiusure. I fantomatici "ristori" sono ridicoli: circa il 3% del fatturato,
    per non parlare dell’agonia delle casse integrazioni. Inaccettabili, poi, le chiusure imposte ai
    locali dopo le ingenti spese sostenute per adeguarsi alle norme anticontagio. Noi vogliamo dirlo
    con chiarezza: i ristoranti sono luoghi sicuri e vanno completamente riaperti.""Le
    multinazionali, attraverso il digitale con la compiacenza del Governo, stanno cannibalizzando un
    mercato che senza le restrizioni non avrebbero potuto arraffare. I Dpcm avvantaggiano modelli a
    noi culturalmente estranei, che abbasseranno la qualità della nostra alimentazione. Il ‘delivery
    food’ obbligato è un socio occulto per gli imprenditori: non offre nulla, non mette capitali, ma
    detta regole e drena dividendi. I grandi gruppi lo collegheranno presto alle ‘ghost kitchen’:
    quattro mura in cui schiavi sottopagati scaldano e spediscono prodotti preconfezionati. In
    sostanza, la fine della ristorazione e della socializzazione. I nostri ristoranti – conclude la
    nota – sono invece garanzia di ricchezza diffusa, tradizione, salute e socialità, per questo
    motivo ci schiereremo sempre dalla loro parte." </text>

    qui rongent les milieux militants, ces anachroniques îlots d’engagement et d’idéal perdus au
    milieu de l’océan sans cesse grossissant de l’égoïsme et du matérialisme, la tentation du
    découragement est peut-être le plus répandu et le plus profond.Bien rares, en effet, sont ceux
    qui peuvent affirmer n’avoir jamais ressenti au moins l’ombre de ce mal qui voile les énergies
    et écrase les volontés. Bien rares sont ceux qui n’ont pas, face à l’extrême modestie ou à la
    quasi-inexistence des résultats obtenus, été tentés de quitter le camp retranché saccagé et
    battu par les vents pour rejoindre l’apaisante veulerie du troupeau.En fait, pour presque tout
    militant, le découragement est un ennemi intime qui, tapis au fond du cœur ou de l’âme, guette
    l’instant propice pour frapper sous les formes les plus diverses, du cynisme à l’abandon pur et
    simple en passant par la trop fameuse " prise de recul ". Ainsi, combattre sans cesse et
    rageusement cet ennemi mortel est-il l’un des plus impérieux et constants devoirs du militant
    car lui céder n’est pas une simple faiblesse, c’est une trahison." Les résultats sont médiocres
    ? Les victoires tardent? " Mais qu’en est-il de mon investissement, de mon travail? Ai-je tout
    fait ce qui était en mon pouvoir pour faire progresser les choses? N’aurais-je pas pu consacrer
    plus de temps, d’argent, à la cause, coller plus d’affiches, lire plus de livres, rédiger plus
    d’articles, parler à davantage de connaissances…? N’ai-je pas manqué de générosité, d’entrain,
    d’audace, d’imagination? Voilà les questions que devrait se poser un militant plutôt que de se
    lamenter et de chercher une discrète porte de sortie… Pour avoir le droit d’être " découragé ",
    il faudrait pouvoir se faire toutes ses interrogations et en conclure que " oui ", on a bien
    tout donné et tout fait, tout essayé et tout tenté… Mais qui peut avoir la prétention de
    l’affirmer sans rougir? Hors cette impossible réponse, comment alors prétendre être " découragé
    " par des efforts finalement modestes, un engagement partiel, des sacrifices dérisoires et des
    difficultés superficielles, si ce n’est par simple aboulie et banale pusillanimité? Je me plains
    d’une dénonciation sur internet ou d’une fâcherie familiale mais celui qui a passé 6 mois
    derrière les barreaux, lui, continue à croire et à combattre.Quand aux grandes victoires il est
    d’évidence qu’elles ne sont pas à portée d’existence humaine, que le travail d'aujourd’hui est
    celui du semis et de la fondation. Mais n’en n’avons nous pas déjà de petites qui, à elles
    seules, justifient largement tout?Ces camarades que l’on peut faire venir en pleine nuit sur un
    simple coup de téléphone, ces quelques familles sauvées de la rue, ces rires au fond d’un pub
    jusqu’au petit matin, cette jeune fille qui sourit doucement en tractant un dimanche sous la
    pluie, cette communauté qui offre un toit et un accueil un peu partout dans le monde, ces gens
    prêts à donner et prendre des coups pour autre chose que leur portefeuille… infinité de petits

    matière de culture politique. Sur le plan des idées, j’ai d’abord acquis une culture de droite.
    Elle s’est ajoutée à ma culture philosophique, en se combinant plus ou moins bien avec elle. Je
    me suis ensuite employé à acquérir une culture de gauche. Une telle démarche me paraît toute
    naturelle : comment peut-on trancher autrement que de manière arbitraire quand on ne connaît pas
    les points de vue en présence ? Prendre position, c’est se situer par rapport aux arguments et
    aux contre-arguments, ce qui implique de les connaître. Avoir à la fois une culture de droite et
    de gauche permet en outre d’identifier dans toute doctrine ce qui peut être sa par de vérité (et
    aussi sa part d’erreur). L’esprit partisan veut ignorer cela. La plupart des gens ne lisent que
    ce avec quoi ils se sentent en accord. Cela leur donne du plaisir et cela les rassure. Ils ont
    besoin d’être confortés dans ce qu’ils pensent déjà. Il ne leur vient pas à l’idée de chercher à
    savoir, objectivement, ce que pensent leurs adversaires. Ils pressentent obscurément qu’ils ne
    sauraient pas quoi répondre. Cela risquerait d’entamer leurs certitudes, de contredire leur
    aspiration à de petits catéchismes simplificateurs. Combien de gens de droite connaissent le
    contenu du débat théorique engagé dans les années 1930 entre Walter Benjamin et Theodor W.

    villes, elles chantent plus haut que leurs bruits, elles y implantent ce qui leur manquait. Il
    est trop facile de montrer ce que leur doit l'homme cultivé qui en embrasse toute la beauté, ou
    le croyant qui y retrempe son âme. Il faudrait montrer ce qu'elles valent pour celui-là même qui
    s'imagine ne rien leur devoir. Il croit s'en passer , mais il les voit en passant, il y est
    quelquefois entré par hasard. Même s'il n'a pas trempé ses doigts dans le bénitier, il a senti
    sur son front l'ineffable baptême d'ombre qui tombent des voûtes ; la médiocrité de sa vie s'est
    trouvée interrompue et déconcertée pendant un instant. Même s'il n'a pas admiré, il s'est du
    moins étonné ; une prière informe a peut-être émergé de son cœur. Ces cathédrales sont à la fois
    ce que nous serions incapables de recréer et ce qui nous représente encore. Supérieures sans
    nous être étrangères, leur magnificence se déploie aux confins de notre indigence. "Abel

    Il est un mécanisme psychologique tout à fait étonnant que l'on peut observer dans les milieux
    les plus critiques et les plus vindicatifs envers la modernité et son actuelle forme
    turbo-capitaliste. En effet, ceux-ci ne semblent finalement pas réellement croire eux-mêmes à
    leurs prédictions catastrophistes et à leurs promesses de cataclysmes. Leur analyse des maux,
    dérives et impasses du système est pourtant souvent d'une très grande justesse et d'une
    remarquable acuité et leurs prévisions apocalyptiques d'une glaçante vraisemblance. Cependant
    ils ne paraissent pas intégrer concrètement, charnellement pourrait-on dire, leurs propres
    conclusions et en tirer les conséquences pratiques qu'elles devraient induire dans leurs
    existences quotidiennes. Ils dénoncent, fort justement, la virtualisation croissante de
    l'économie contemporaine mais continuent à gérer un petit portefeuille d'actions et à acquérir
    des titres dans l'espoir d'un " bon coup " (pour les vieux jours… qu'ils semblent toujours
    situer " avant " le temps des grands drames…), ils annoncent une récession sans précédent mais
    vivent toujours en location au centre ville des grandes agglomérations urbaines au lieu de
    chercher à regagner provinces et campagnes et à investir dans la terre et la pierre qui sont
    autant de solides refuges, ils prévoient une crise bancaire du type de celle de 1929 mais
    alimentent régulièrement leur livret d'épargne, ils voient s'avancer le spectre d'un
    effondrement " à l'argentine " mais ne cherchent pas à élaborer et à faire vivre des systèmes
    alternatifs (logements communautaires, restaurants sociaux, mutuelle militante, système
    d'échange et de prêts gratuits…)… En fait, il semble qu'ils ne parviennent pas véritablement à
    s'extraire de la théorie, si remarquable et efficiente soit-elle, pour passer à la phase "
    active " que devrait susciter leur doctrine. N'ayant connu que ce système consuméro-libéral
    depuis leur berceau, ils ont développé, malgré eux, une sorte de confiance magique en sa
    capacité d'adaptation et de sursaut. Face à cela, la " catastrophe " n'est qu'une pure
    construction intellectuelle. Ils l'annoncent depuis des années, voir des décennies, mais, si
    rien ne change, elle les surprendra dans le même état de dénuement et d'impréparation que tous
    les autres… </text>

    8:Tyrannie sanitaire. Tyrannie idéologique. Tyrannie mémorielle. Chaque jour l’étau se resserre
    un peu plus sur les derniers vestiges de nos libertés. Le port du masque obligatoire dans les
    espaces publics est bien évidemment le symbole, à la fois tragique et éclatant, de cette
    domestication de la population, de son muselage et de sa soumission. Nous n’avions déjà plus le
    droit de penser librement, d’aimer prioritairement ceux que nous voulions, de connaître la
    réalité de notre histoire, dans sa grandeur comme dans sa complexité, de défendre notre cadre de
    vie et de vivre selon nos traditions. Désormais, nous avons à peine le droit de sortir, nos
    activités privées sont soumises à conditions, les interdictions et réglementations se
    multiplient de façon aussi exponentielle qu’incohérente. Et cela ne risque pas de s’arranger…
    L’ombre de la vaccination obligatoire, voir du puçage, s’étend déjà sur notre avenir proche.Très
    clairement, l’oligarchie et son bras fonctionnel qu’est l’Etat ont fait sécession vis-à-vis du
    peuple dont ils avaient la charge. Avec la Covid-19 et ses conséquences, nous sommes passés
    d’une guerre larvée à une guerre ouverte, la machine s’est emballée et le totalitarisme " soft "
    s’est soudain brutalement durci. Le français vit désormais terrorisé, surveillé par des flics à
    chaque coin de rue et des censeurs à chaque page web, n’ayant plus qu’un seul droit : celui
    d’aller bosser pour nourrir le marché et la méga-machine économique. Qui, pourtant, peut
    réellement croire que toutes ces mesures liberticides ont pour motivation le souci de la santé
    publique ? Qui peut croire qu’un gouvernement et des " élites " qui laissent chaque jour, depuis
    des décennies, les français se faire insulter, agresser, violer et assassiner par des barbares
    impunis ont un quelconque intérêt pour l’état de nos poumons et notre espérance de vie ? Qui
    peut penser qu’un personnel politique qui organise sciemment l’invasion migratoire et le grand
    remplacement puisse être motivé par une volonté de préservation d’un peuple dont il veut au
    contraire se débarrasser ?En tant que militants politiques nationalistes-révolutionnaires, nous
    savons depuis fort longtemps que l’Etat est notre ennemi. Cela devient aujourd’hui une évidence
    pour l’ensemble de notre peuple. A nous d’incarner une alternative concrète à celui-ci, une
    véritable contre-société, un refuge qui deviendra demain le camp de base de la reconquête. Dans
    cette optique, nous devons chaque jour davantage resserrer nos liens communautaires, amicaux,
    familiaux, tisser un réseau socio-économique qui nous soit propre, développer nos ressources,
    disposer de nos médias, de nos restaurants, de nos jardins potagers, de nos écoles… Car leur
    monde n’est plus seulement laid, violent, absurde et injuste, il est devenu purement et

    peuvent expliquer la " fragilité " de nombreux jeunes Européens et leur " vulnérabilité " dans
    les environnements multi-agressifs dans lesquels ils sont plongés :Le premier facteur relève de
    mauvaises pratiques dans la construction identitaire de l’enfant ;Le deuxième d’une influence
    trop incapacitante (castratrice même) des pratiques pédagogiques qui dévalorisent le conflit, la
    bagarre ou prétendent obliger l’enfant à s’en remettre toujours à quelqu’un d’autre (les
    institutions notamment) pour le protéger ;Le troisième point relève d’un choix d’hygiène de vie
    (sport, alimentation et bonnes pratiques qui sont importantes à l’heure des pollutions
    agro-chimiques systématiques) ;Et enfin, le dernier facteur est une qualité que les spécialistes
    nomment " néoténie " ou persistance juvénile, qui est liée à notre biologie. Elle présente de
    nombreux inconvénients dans un contexte social multiethnique et multiculturel, mais est, à tout

    crainte de devoir faire face au grand frère, aux copains, à la famille, etc. de son adversaire
    pèse dans le rapport de forces. Les jeunes Européens sont fréquemment isolés et l’isolement est
    la première des faiblesses. Les enfants privés de construction identitaire saine sont et
    resteront seuls. Isolés de tout groupe, famille, etc., quand survient le conflit, ils sont
    souvent en position de faiblesse face à de petits groupes soudés par toutes les formes
    d’appartenance (origine, famille, couleur de peau, cultures, religions, marques, etc.) et
    parfois par des groupes soudés par plusieurs de ces catégories simultanément. Cet isolement est

    l’argent contre la puissance spirituelle. L’industrie aussi est encore liée à la terre comme la
    paysannerie. Elle a son lieu d’origine et ses sources de matière jaillissant du sol. Seule la
    haute finance est tout à fait libre, tout a fait insaisissable. Les banques et aussi les bourses
    se sont développées depuis 1789 (grâce au besoin de crédit de l’industrie croissant à l’infini)
    en une puissance propre et veulent être, comme l’argent dans toutes les civilisations, la
    puissance unique. La lutte originelle entre l’économie productive et l’économie conquérante
    s’élève à une silencieuse lutte titanique des esprits, qui se décide sur le sol des villes
    mondiales. C’est la lutte désespérée de la pensée technique pour sa liberté menacée par la
    pensée financière.La dictature de l’argent progresse et se rapproche d’une apogée naturelle,
    dans la civilisation faustienne comme dans toutes les autres. Et il se produit alors une chose,
    qui ne peut être comprise que par celui qui a sondé la nature de l’argent. S’il était une chose
    concrète, son existence serait éternelle ; comme il est une forme de la pensée, il s’éteint dès
    qu’il a pensé jusqu’au bout le monde économique, et ce par manque de substance. Il a envahi la
    vie du paysage rural et mis le sol en mouvement ; il a transformé les affaires de chaque
    artisanat ; il pénètre aujourd’hui en vainqueur dans l’industrie pour faire également son butin
    du travail productif des entrepreneurs, des ingénieurs et des ouvriers. La machine avec son
    armée humaine, véritable maîtresse du siècle, est en danger de tomber sous une puissance plus
    forte. Mais ainsi l’argent arrive au bout de ses succès, et le dernier combat commence, qui
    donnera à la civilisation sa forme définitive : le combat de l’argent et du sang.L’avènement du
    césarisme brise la dictature de l’argent et de son arme politique, la démocratie. Après un long
    triomphe, de l’économie de la ville mondiale et de ses intérêts, sur la force plastique
    politique, le côté politique de la vie ne se révélera pas moins le plus fort. L’épée vaincra
    l’argent, la volonté du seigneur s’assujettira à nouveau la volonté du pirate. Si on appelle ces
    forces de l’argent le capitalisme, et si le socialisme est la volonté de faire naître, par delà
    tous les intérêts de classe, une puissante organisation politico-économique, un système du souci
    et du devoir supérieur, qui consolide l’ensemble pour la lutte décisive de l’histoire, cela sera
    en même temps une lutte entre l’argent et le droit. Les puissances économiques privées veulent
    frayer la voie à leur conquête des grandes fortunes. Aucune législation ne leur barrera la
    route. Elle veulent légiférer dans leur intérêt et se servent, pour ce faire, de l’instrument
    qu’elles se sont créé elles-mêmes : la démocratie, le parti qu’elles paient. Le droit a besoin,
    pour parer à cet assaut, d’une tradition supérieure, de l’ambition des fortes familles qui
    trouvent leur satisfaction non dans l’accumulation des richesses, mais dans les devoirs de
    l’autorité authentique, par delà tous les avantages financiers. Une puissance ne peut être
    détruite que par une autre, non par un principe, et il n’y en a point d’autre contre
    l’argent. L’argent ne sera dominé que par le sang et supprimé par lui. "— Oswald Spengler, Le
    Déclin de l’Occident </text>

    dernières générations en Europe, sur le plan alimentaire notamment, a profondément bouleversé
    les métabolismes pour des raisons en partie sanitaires (généralisation des perturbateurs
    endocriniens à corréler avec la baisse de fécondité et l’augmentation des cancers et
    malformations génitales masculines). Soyez attentifs à l’alimentation de vos enfants et à leurs
    contacts répétés avec les perturbateurs endocriniens contenus dans les aliments conditionnés en
    boîte, aux contacts avec toutes formes de plastiques et choisissez des vêtements adaptés, plutôt
    amples. Pour les bébés, proscrivez les jouets et tétines en plastique, privilégiez les cuillères
    en bois simple. Ne donnez pas de petits pots pour bébé mais des aliments que vous préparerez
    vous-même, si possible biologiques ou issus d’un potager non traité aux pesticides, herbicides
    et autres intrants chimiques toxiques. Certes, cette préparation demande du temps quotidien mais
    les conséquences sont autrement importantes… Je ne peux détailler sur cette question, il me
    faudrait un livre entier.Les pratiques sportives sont aussi essentielles. Je n’évoquerai même
    pas la majorité des garçons qui n’ont presque aucune activité sportive (une catastrophe
    sanitaire) alors qu’ils passent 6 à 7 heures par jour assis sur une chaise en pleine période de
    développement, puis le reste de la journée devant la télévision ou l’ordinateur. N’espérez pas
    avoir des enfants sains avec ce régime de vie. Ils seront des cibles et, consciemment ou non, se
    retrancheront de la vie réelle pour fuir des rapports de force auxquels ils ne sont pas
    préparés. Pour vos garçons, privilégiez dès 6 ans des activités de contact (rugby, etc.) et,
    d’une façon générale, le contact direct avec la difficulté, la nature, le froid, le chaud, le
    piquant, aussi souvent que possible. Non dans une perspective de souffrance, et en songeant
    toujours que vous devez valoriser sans le plaindre ses échecs et ses bosses.Laurent Ozon </text>

  <text date="01.25.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="606"> On apprend tôt aux enfants à " aller
    voir la maîtresse " lorsqu’ils sont victimes de coups ou d’agressions, pas assez à se défendre
    eux-mêmes ou, au minimum, à faire face à une situation de conflit. Pas intellectuellement, mais
    physiquement, avec leurs instincts. Le courage n’est pas une construction intellectuelle et ne
    se forge pas avec des mots mais avec l’expérience directe, physique, instinctive de la vie, des
    difficultés et de la souffrance physique. La culture des normes et de la résolution pacifique du
    conflit, voire du conflit comme " échec ", est une tendance lourde et particulièrement
    pernicieuse dans nos sociétés, en particulier pour les instincts virils. Ce travail de formatage
    des institutions publiques, qui invite les enfants et les citoyens à s’en remettre à
    l’institution dans la gestion des conflits tout en sachant parfaitement que ces institutions ne
    remplissent pas ce rôle et ne le pourront jamais, est une catastrophe sur le plan éducatif et
    ses impacts sur la population autochtone particulièrement lourds. La prépondérance des valeurs
    maternelles qui doivent savoir progressivement se placer en retrait à partir de quatre ou cinq
    ans dans l’éducation du jeune garçon et le manque de présence des valeurs de pères viennent
    renforcer à chaque instant ces tendances.La culture de l’honneur individuel et familial doit
    précéder la culture de la norme sociale de la collectivité politique. Les instincts de défense
    ne doivent pas être inhibés par un matraquage moral maternant ou par une culture de la
    légitimité supposée des corps de l’Etat dans l’exercice de la violence légitime. Et ce pour une
    raison simple : il n’assure pas correctement cette mission et ne l’assurera jamais. Le respect
    des règles deviendra plus tard un prétexte à son manque d’esprit de défense, d’initiative, de
    révolte. Loin de toute culture suprémaciste (" nous sommes les meilleurs ") aux effets
    accablants lorsqu’on ne domine pas un rapport de forces, apprenez-lui aussi à perdre et
    donnez-lui l’envie de recommencer et de gagner. Faites comprendre à votre garçon que ce qui est
    honteux ce n’est pas de perdre une bataille, un moment de conflit, mais de s’y dérober par
    lâcheté. Que perdre c’est parfois triste mais c’est honorable, en tout cas plus que de se
    soumettre. Revaloriser et soutenir son enfant, y compris dans ses manifestations d’agressivité
    (parfois inadéquates), c’est légitimer son agressivité naturelle et l’aider à gérer le conflit
    par ses propres moyens. Ne pas lui apprendre à chercher le soutien des adultes et de
    l’institution, qui dans l’immense majorité des cas ne le protégera pas lorsqu’il en aura besoin.
    Cet aspect de l’éducation des jeunes garçons est fondamental.Quelques exemples pratiques ? Ne
    relevez pas un enfant en bas âge lorsqu’il tombe mais encouragez-le à se relever seul jusqu’à ce
    qu’il réussisse et félicitez-le lorsque c’est fait, par des mots ou un geste de tendresse. Ne
    grondez pas votre enfant s’il manifeste de l’agressivité ou de la violence raisonnable dans une
    relation avec d’autres enfants, n’intervenez que s’il y a un réel risque et de façon non morale
    mais disciplinaire. Apprenez, certes, à votre enfant l’existence des normes collectives mais
    sans jamais oublier de lui rappeler la première de toutes les normes : la survie et la capacité
    de se faire respecter et de se défendre. Valorisez cela à chaque fois que nécessaire.La capacité
    d’un garçon à exprimer ses préférences, à exprimer son agressivité, à régler les conflits par
    lui-même, sans chercher un appui, est une condition indispensable à sa construction virile. L’en
    priver c’est l’exposer, l’affaiblir, le mettre en danger. Si vous espérez un jour pouvoir
    compter sur son aide et sa force, c’est donc vous mettre en danger, vous aussi.Laurent Ozon </text>

    appartenait, comme nous tous, à une génération sacrifiée. Elle avait certainement été capable
    d’amour ; elle aurait souhaité en être encore capable, je lui rends ce témoignage ; mais cela
    n’était plus possible. Phénomène rare, artificiel et tardif, l’amour ne peut s’épanouir que dans
    des conditions mentales spéciales, rarement réunies, en tous points opposées à la liberté de
    mœurs qui caractérise l’époque moderne. Véronique avait connu trop de discothèques et d’amants ;
    un tel mode de vie appauvrit l’être humain, lui infligeant des dommages parfois graves et
    toujours irréversibles. L’amour comme innocence et comme capacité d’illusion, comme aptitude à
    résumer l’ensemble de l’autre sexe à un seul être aimé, résiste rarement à une année de
    vagabondage sexuel, jamais à deux. En réalité, les expériences sexuelles successives accumulées
    au cours de l’adolescence minent et détruisent rapidement toute possibilité de projection
    d’ordre sentimental et romanesque ; progressivement, et en fait assez vite, on devient aussi
    capable d’amour qu’un vieux torchon. Et on mène ensuite, évidemment, une vie de torchon ; en
    vieillissant on devient moins séduisant, et de ce fait amer. On jalouse les jeunes, et de ce
    fait on les hait. Cette haine, condamnée à rester inavouable, s’envenime et devient de plus en

    tromper, mais j'ai l'impression que la fragmentation du milieu est en train de prendre des
    formes ultra agressives, de guerre civile. S'il est vrai que - comme dans chaque groupe humain -
    quand on sent la pression extérieure on commence à faire la chasse autour de soi au traître ou
    au défaitiste, et même s'il est vrai aussi qu'il faudrait essayer de ne pas répéter comme des
    automates les erreurs du passé - je parle du passé au sens général, l'Histoire - il faudrait
    selon moi fixer des règles à cette guerre civile, même si la guerre civile est une saleté parce
    que justement elle n'obéit à aucune règle. Mais il faut limiter le genre d'affrontements que
    l'on peut avoir entre "camarades". Il n'est pas normal de s'acharner sur des gens du milieu et
    de se montrer en revanche prêt à tous les compromis avec l'extérieur. C'est une façon maladive,
    psychotique de concevoir le militantisme. Il est facile de s'attaquer au camarade "ennemi",
    parce qu'on le connaît, on sait "combien il vaut" et qui le protège... L'ennemi extérieur, au
    contraire, effraie toujours d'avantage, parce que d'une certaine façon il est inconnu. Je
    voudrais vraiment que cette simple réalité objective suffise à empêcher des actions sans
    scrupule à l'intérieur d'un milieu déjà suffisamment menacé par l'extérieur. </text>

    zappeurs sans constance, des profils psychologiques fragiles ou des cyber " militants ". Les
    quelques personnes qui cultivent encore la constance des anciens militants, se retrouvent bien

    (eux-mêmes étant totalement inutiles et inféconds).Le militantisme étant la forme structurée et
    coordonnée de l’engagement dans la pratique du XXème siècle, il est normal qu’il ne réponde plus
    aux enjeux du XXI siècle. On ne fait vivre un idéal qu’en l’incarnant et en lui donnant une

    haut du nez" (on leur fait le geste sur notre figure, libre elle, de toute obstruction). Dans 1
    cas sur 2 la personne s’exécute. Plus on prend un air de gravité, plus le taux de réussite
    s’élève, et plus le masque s’élève sur le visage de la victime "oui, oui, plus haut, oui vous y
    êtes voilà". Dans certains cas très bien travaillés il est même possible d’amener le masque
    presque sur les yeux de la personne et de la laisser continuer son chemin quasi-aveuglée. Cela
    fonctionne sur tous types de personnes, cailleras comprises, tant que l’on conserve un air
    sérieux. Défense toutefois de faire le jeu sur des vieux. Cibler les frimeurs.Dans certains cas

    des Européens, est un trait caractéristique qui n’empêche pas une maturation finale équivalente
    en virilité mais la diffère. Qu’est-ce que cela veut dire ? Simplement qu’aux mêmes âges, nous,
    Européens, sommes plus jeunes. Exemple : l’âge de la puberté est sensiblement plus précoce chez
    les Subsahariens que chez les Européens. Ceci affecte la croissance et la maturité musculaire.
    En clair, un Européen de 14 ans sera statistiquement moins avancé dans sa puberté (et donc sa
    taille, son développement musculaire, son agressivité, etc.) qu’un Subsaharien du même âge : un
    inconvénient, mais un avantage sur d’autres points. Si notre maturité est plus tardive, notre
    phase de maturation est plus longue…La juvénilité est un inconvénient face à des brutes précoces
    physiquement mais elle constitue un avantage réel et en tout cas une réalité avec laquelle il
    faut compter lorsqu’il s’agit de vérifier les caractéristiques de l’adulte abouti et finalement
    formé.Afin de compenser cette particularité (dont il existe, bien sûr, des exceptions), les
    activités viriles et les pratiques sanitaires adéquates, comme la construction identitaire
    correctement effectuée, suffisent largement. Ne vous étonnez pas de faire fréquemment ce
    constat. Les Européens sont plus jeunes, plus souples, plus ouverts et curieux et leur période
    de maturation est significativement plus longue que celles d’autres populations, en particulier
    des populations subsahariennes. Les populations arabo-berbères ont des caractéristiques proches
    des nôtres de ce point de vue, mais elles sont compensées chez elles par une construction
    identitaire plus traditionnelle (sexe, famille, peuple).Laurent Ozon </text>

    riabbracciare i nostri ragazzi e convinti della loro innocenza rispetto al reato contestato, ci
    aspettiamo adesso che cadano tutte le accuse infondate mosse contro di loro per ragioni di

    un peu honteuse de beauté physique, certains individus parviennent toutefois à compenser leurs
    carences par l’ingénierie sociale (popularité au sein d’un groupe, capacité à " se vendre ").
    Universellement admis, les critères de la beauté physique transcendent les cultures et les
    nations par leur aspect objectif : largeur du visage, finesse des traits (notamment de l’arête
    du nez), rectitude de l’ossature (notamment des jambes) etc. En occident, les rares individus
    féminins validant l’intégralité des critères forment une toute petite partie de gens à
    l’intérieur de l’ethnie dite caucasienne, elle-même comptant pour une infime partie de la
    totalité des humains. En général, le simple fait d’articuler ce constat d’évidence vous attire
    la réprobation générale, surtout de la part des caucasiens eux-même, qui auront tôt fait de
    prononcer le terme magique de racisme. L. Darbois </text>

  <text date="02.04.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="494"> Dix ans de chaos en Libye.Il y a dix
    ans, au mois de février 2011, éclatait la guerre civile de Libye. Le 10 mars Nicolas Sarkozy
    s’immisça dans ce conflit interne en reconnaissant une délégation de rebelles comme représentant
    la légalité libyenne !!!La France entra ensuite dans un conflit dans lequel ses intérêts
    n’étaient aucunement en jeu. Le 19 mars, elle obtint de l’ONU l’autorisation d’emploi de
    l’aviation afin de " protéger les civils ", en réalité, les milices islamistes de Cyrénaïque et
    les Frères musulmans de Misrata…Le but officiel de la guerre décidée par Nicolas Sarkozy était
    l’établissement d’un État de droit. Son résultat fut que les structures étatiques libyennes
    disparurent, cédant la place à des affrontements de milices islamo-mafieuses. Quant au vide
    libyen, il eut des conséquences sur toute la zone tchado-nigériane et sur une partie de la BSS
    [bande sahélo-saharienne, NDLR]. Sans parler de la création d’une pompe aspirante
    migratoire.Cette intervention fit éclater les alliances tribales sur lesquelles reposait la
    stabilité politique de la Libye. Le régime du colonel Kadhafi avait en effet réussi à faire
    cohabiter centre et périphérie, en articulant les pouvoirs et la rente des hydrocarbures sur les
    réalités locales.Politiquement, la Libye se caractérise en effet par la faiblesse du pouvoir
    central par rapport aux permanences tribales. Véritables " fendeurs d’horizons ", les tribus les
    plus fortes contrôlent ces couloirs de nomadisation reliant la Méditerranée à la région
    tchadienne à travers lesquels se font les trafics d’aujourd’hui (drogue et migrants) et
    s’ancrent les solidarités jihadistes.Faute d’avoir pris en compte ces données, ceux qui, au nom
    de l’illusion démocratique, déclenchèrent la calamiteuse intervention de 2011, sont les
    responsables de l’actuel chaos. En effet, les deux clés de la vie politique libyenne sont le
    tribalisme et le fédéralisme.1) La Libye est naturellement multi centrée et le renversement du
    colonel Kadhafi a amplifié cette réalité en donnant naissance à de multiples lieux de pouvoir
    indépendants et à des rivalités de légitimités nées de la guerre. Stabiliser la Libye ne peut
    donc se faire qu’en prenant en compte son archéologie tribale. L’échec de l’État islamique
    aurait pourtant pu servir de leçon. Ce fut en effet la définition tribale du pays qui fut
    l’obstacle au califat universel prôné par l’EI, les fortes identités tribales ayant rendu
    impossible la greffe d’un mouvement composé majoritairement d’étrangers. Comment donc prétendre
    vouloir mettre un terme au conflit actuel quand les tribus, pourtant les seules vraies forces
    politiques du pays sont écartées des négociations ?2) La Libye n’a pas de centre unificateur.
    Les trois provinces la composant n’ont aucun point de soudure et sont séparées par une masse
    saharienne vide à 95 %, alors que plus de 80 % de la population est concentrée sur une étroite
    bande côtière.La solution passe donc par deux impératifs : 1) La reconstitution des alliances
    tribales forgées par le colonel Kadhafi. 2) Un vrai fédéralisme, car la Cyrénaïque n’acceptera
    jamais la fiction d’un État libyen dominé par la Tripolitaine… et vice-versa.Bernard Lugan </text>

  <text date="02.07.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="527"> Schwingen (from German schwingen "to
    swing"), also known as Swiss wrestling and as Hoselupf (Swiss German for "breeches-lifting"), is
    a style of folk wrestling native to Switzerland, more specifically the pre-alpine parts of
    German-speaking Switzerland. Wrestlers wear Schwingerhosen ("wrestling breeches") with belts
    that are used for taking holds. Throws and trips are common because the first person to pin his
    or her opponent's shoulders to the ground wins the bout.Schwingen is considered a "national
    sport" of Switzerland. The modern history of organized Schwingen tournaments begins with the
    Unspunnenfest of 1805. Traditionally, Schwingen is a male sport. Members of a pure Schwingen
    club are called Sennenschwinger and wear dark trousers and a colored shirt, usually bright blue.
    Members of a broader sports club with a Schwingen section are called Turnerschwinger, and wear
    white pants and a white T-shirt.Advertising and sponsoring are shunned at Schwingen. Successful
    Schwingers do not receive cash prizes, but goods such as cowbells, furniture or livestock.The
    best Schwingers at a festival are awarded a wreath. Schwingers who receive a wreath at an
    Eidgenössische or national tournament are called Eidgenossen (confederates). Good Schwingers at
    national level are called "Böse" (wicked).A winner of the Eidgenössische is given the lifetime
    title of Schwingerkönig (Schwinger king), which includes some privileges such as being a guest
    of honor at every EidgenössischeThe match takes place in a ring, a circular area with a diameter
    of 12 meters that is covered with sawdust. The two opponents wear short pants made of jute over
    their clothes. The wrestlers hold each other by these pants, at the back where the belt meets,
    and try to throw the opponent onto his back. There are several main throws, with names like
    "kurz", "übersprung" and "wyberhaagge", some of them very similar to judo techniques - "hüfter"
    is almost identical to koshi guruma, "brienzer" is basically uchi mata. These throws are found
    in many wrestling systems that have even the slightest emphasis on throwing the opponent, and
    can also been seen in shuaijiao. A match is won when the winner holds the opponent's pants with
    at least one hand and both the opponent's shoulders touch the ground. By tradition the winner
    brushes the sawdust off the loser's back after the match.The match is judged by three referees,
    one of whom stands in the ring. The referees give points, with a maximum of ten points for a
    winning throw. If the match ends without a clear win, the more active Schwinger is awarded the
    higher number of points.At a Schwing festival, every Schwinger wrestles six opponents, or eight
    at the Eidgenössische. The two Schwingers with the highest number of points after five (seven at
    the Eidgenössische) matches get to the Schlussgang (last round). The matching of the Schwingers
    is done by the fight court according to arcane rules. Often there are suspicions that the
    matchings have not been fair, and favor one contestant over the others.There are no weight
    classes nor any other categories. Usually, though, Schwingers are big men, over 180 cm tall and
    weighing in excess of 100 kg, and are mostly craftsmen from traditional professions that require
    some physical force, like carpenters, butchers, lumberjacks or cheesemakers. </text>

    Escoffier était au moment de son sacrifice le trésorier du Comité de liaison d’action
    nationaliste, le CLAN. Père d’une fillette de 6 ans, il était passionné de musique et de photo.
    Son père avait combattu dans l’OAS et son épouse était une réfugiée de RDA.Le vendredi 10
    février, une énième manifestation devant l’agence de l’Aéroflot à Paris sur les Champs-Élysées,
    lieu symbolique de la respectabilité du soviétisme en France, fut annoncée. En présence d’un
    important service d’ordre de la Préfecture de police, quelques centaines de militants se
    rassemblèrent dans le calme, peu avant 15 heures. Tout à coup, au milieu des slogans hostiles à
    l’URSS et au communisme en général, un homme jeune, en veste et cravate, se détacha de la foule.
    Il portait à la main deux jerricans en plastique. Profitant de l’inattention de la police, il
    entra dans le hall de l’agence soviétique, eut juste le temps de s’asperger de l’essence
    contenue dans les jerricans, lança un dernier " communistes assassins ", puis s’enflamma.
    Aussitôt, quelques employés russes de l’Aéroflot tentèrent de le secourir en utilisant un
    extincteur à poudre, en vain. Gravement brûlé, il fut transporté d’urgence à l’hôpital Foch de
    Suresnes, où il décéda de ses blessures.Bien que séparé de son épouse, et ayant mis un certain
    temps à accuser le coup, Escoffier était loin d’être un déséquilibré comme l’ont prétendu
    d’infâmes articles parus dans la presse. Interrogé par Rivarol, son beau-père fut
    particulièrement clair sur ses motivations : " Alain s’est suicidé pour des raisons politiques,

    répandre dans tous les domaines de la vie sociale et de la civilisation s'il y avait eu de vrais

    la mémoire des victimes du massacre des Foibe par les troupes communistes de Tito dans les
    régions de l’Istrie, d’une partie de la Dalmatie, du Frioul et de Tagliamento.Ce jour célébré en
    Italie depuis 2005 entend entretenir le souvenir de l’opération délibérée de nettoyage ethnique,
    voulue par le maréchal Tito pour assurer par la terreur sa domination sur la Vénétie julienne et
    l’Istrie (et donc sur la population italienne) mais aussi pour se débarrasser d’opposants
    politiques y compris yougoslaves. Privées de toute sorte de " justification " morale ou sociale,
    les foibe de Tito virent la mise en œuvre d’un probable nettoyage ethnique (pour lequel seuls
    des indices épars sont concordants) et selon toute vraisemblance politique : outre des Italiens,
    qu’il s’agisse d’innocents ou d’ex-fascistes, périrent aussi des partisans opposés à la
    Yougoslavie de Tito. Elles entraient dans un plan général visant à annexer pour étendre le
    territoire yougoslave toutes les zones peuplées en majorité d’Italiens mais où existait une
    minorité linguistique slave, aussi minime soit-elle, c’est-à-dire l’Istrie, une partie de la

  <text date="02.12.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="326"> Principalement implantée dans le
    Finistère, la lutte bretonne, ou " gouren ", est un sport traditionnel que l'on avait coutume de
    pratiquer lors des rassemblements populaires, tels que les jours de pardons. D'origine celte,
    elle est similaire à d'autres luttes pratiquées dans des pays celtiques, comme l'Ecosse ou la
    Cornouailles britannique. C'est une lutte de corps à corps, l'objectif étant de faire tomber son
    adversaire sur les deux omoplates.Le terme gouren est mentionné dès 1464 dans Le Catholicon, le
    tout premier dictionnaire trilingue où l’on peut lire : " gouren : lutter ; gourener : lutteur
    ".Il s’agit d’une lutte pratiquée exclusivement debout dont le but est de mettre sur le dos son
    adversaire avant toute autre partie du corps. C’est ce que l’on appelle le " lamm " qui donne le
    gain immédiat du combat. Une autre spécificité du gouren, c’est que les mains agrippent
    uniquement dans la roched (la chemise en breton) et les jambes bien-sûr peuvent s’accrocher
    entre elles permettant de nombreuses techniques comme les barrages, les fauchages (taolioù gar),
    les balayages (taolioù skarzh) ou encore le fameux kliked (enroulé d’orteil autour du mollet de
    son adversaire) qui a forgé la réputation des lutteurs bretons et que certains chroniqueurs ou
    écrivains nommaient " croc en jambe " ou encore " jambette à la mode de Bretagne ".La notion de
    respect de l’adversaire est primordiale. Le gouren a hérité de valeurs chevaleresques du Moyen
    Âge qui ont perduré au cours des siècles. Les lutteurs, aujourd’hui encore, prêtent serment
    avant chaque tournoi. On ne peut combattre sans avoir au préalable levé la main droite et juré "
    de lutter en toute loyauté, sans traîtrise et sans brutalité… " Chaque lutteur témoigne de sa
    sincérité par ce serment et s’engage à respecter la coutume des ancêtres. Commettre un fazi (une
    faute en breton) donne un avantage important à l’adversaire, avoir un comportement violent ou
    dire une parole injurieuse entraîne immédiatement le divrud (la disqualification en breton). </text>

    places him firmly among the elite ranks of Third Position thinkers. His doctrine of Justicalism
    and his geopolitical agenda of resistance to both American and Soviet domination of Latin
    America have demonstrated enduring relevance. Influenced by Aristotle’s conception of man as a
    social being and the social teachings of the Catholic Church, Perón proved to be an insightful
    political philosopher, developing a unique interpretation of National Syndicalism that guided
    his Justicalist Party. While his career was marked by turmoil, he pursued an agenda of the
    social justice, seeking the empowerment of the nation’s working classes as a necessary step
    towards the spiritual transformation of the country. Perón’s example stands as a beacon to those

    premiers bourgeons se préparent à poindre. Le carême est donc un temps de préparation à une
    résurrection. Comment le vivre concrètement ? Il nous faut retrouver la paix intérieur
    indispensable à la prière et à la contemplation, pour cela le silence est notre meilleure arme.
    Ecartons-nous du bruit, des notifications intempestives, des flux d'informations et d'images,
    construisons notre citadelle intérieure, trouvons le temps de nous isoler pour prier, méditer et
    contempler. La lecture est aussi indispensable pour nourrir nos pensées. Comme nous ne sommes
    pas de purs esprits, il est bon que nous aidions aussi notre corps à participer à cette
    renaissance intérieure. Quoi de mieux que le jeûne ou du moins un retour à des habitudes plus
    saines : se coucher tôt et se lever tôt, faire du sport, retrouver une alimentation plus
    naturelle, supprimer alcool et tabac pendant un temps. Ces efforts ne seraient qu'une forme
    d'hygiénisme malsain s'ils ne s'accompagnaient pas d'une grande générosité et d'un immense amour
    à l'égard du prochain. Le carême est un temps pour sortir de l'égoïsme ordinaire dans lequel
    nous avons tendance à nous installer par confort. Mettons un frein à nos médisances et à nos
    plaintes, donnons un peu de temps et d'argent à des oeuvres, rendons visites à nos anciens, et

    qui surent combattre tout en étant conscients que la bataille était matériellement perdue, de
    ceux qui surent valider les paroles de la vieille saga : "Fidélité est plus forte que le feu",

    BousquetCORAGGIO!Manuale di guerriglia culturale C’è una leva, dentro di noi, che potrebbe
    sollevare il mondo: è il coraggio. Non attende altro che un nostro segno per attivarsi, per
    farci passare dall’immobilità all’attivismo, dallo statico al dinamico, dall’impossibile al
    possibile. Non chiede che di cambiare la natura stessa dell’essere con le sue sole virtù
    irradianti. È il fulcro che ci manca, la puleggia che ci mette in moto, l’arco che ci spinge,
    gli stivali delle sette leghe che ci fanno camminare a passi da gigante.Lo ha compreso François
    Bousquet, che con "Coraggio!" ha vergato un vero e proprio manifesto ideale e operativo della
    dissidenza. Appassionato, profondo, aggressivo e coinvolgente, questo contributo rappresenta un
    sasso nello stagno del "politicamente corretto", immaginando un’alternativa concreta al dominio
    del "pensiero unico". L’autore restituisce corpo e forma ai riferimenti dell’etica non conforme,
    innalzando il vessillo della Riconquista: dall’epica dei poemi di fondazione alla carica
    identitaria delle grandi opere letterarie, passando per la storia e per la Tradizione della
    stirpe europea. Un messaggio straordinariamente attuale, che risuona come l’eco immortale di una
    sinfonia eroica:"Il coraggio è il vento che soffia verso coste lontane, la chiave di tutti i
    tesori, il martello che ha forgiato i grandi imperi, lo scudo senza il quale la cultura
    soccomberebbe. Il coraggio è l’impegno della singola persona fino alle più estreme conseguenze,
    l’assalto dell’idea alla materia senza remore né ripensamenti. Essere coraggiosi è esser pronti
    a farsi crocifiggere per una fede, è confermare l’idea per cui si è vissuti e caduti, anche
    esalando l’ultimo respiro e un ultimo fremito dei nervi. Al diavolo quest’epoca che ci vuole
    privare del coraggio e degli uomini coraggiosi!"Questo "Manuale di guerriglia culturale" è il
    breviario di ogni ribelle: non è semplicemente un libro, ma un’arma da impugnare nella decisiva
    battaglia di Civiltà che attende al varco gli uomini liberi.INFO &amp; ACQUISTI:[link] <ref

    les nouveaux militants [de la Fédération des Etudiants Nationalistes], en même temps que les "
    Réflexions sur la violence " de Sorel, était le " Que faire ? " de Lénine. On lisait aussi
    Victor Serge, Paul Marion, Tchakhotine. Les communistes s’appelaient entre eux " camarades " ;
    nous, par mimétisme, nous disions " ami ". Nous faisions de ce mot un usage surabondant, qui
    remplaçait souvent celui des prénoms. C’était même parfois poussé jusqu’à la caricature : "
    Bonjour, ami ! Des amis nous ont dit que tu étais un ami. La nuit prochaine un ami passera te
    prendre pour rejoindre des amis qui t’emmèneront à un collage d’affiches ", etc. Tous les
    courriers et circulaires internes commençaient par le mot " Amis " écrit avec une majuscule. Il
    n’y a pas si longtemps, j’ai retrouvé un ancien de la FEN que je n’avais pas vu depuis plus de
    quarante ans. La première chose qu’il m’a dite a été : " Bonjour, ami. " Il n’est pas surprenant
    que nous ayons ensuite, à l’époque d’Europe-Action, ouvert une Librairie de l’Amitié. La vertu
    d’amitié, fondatrice d’une solidarité active, n’est pas réservée à la droite, mais il me semble
    qu’elle compte beaucoup plus qu’à gauche. A gauche, les divergences idéologiques peuvent mettre
    fin à une amitié, ce qui est plus rarement le cas à droite : même si l’on n’est pas d’accord, on
    reste convaincu d’appartenir à la même " famille " -un réflexe qui s’est souvent révélé
    désastreux. "Alain de Benoist. Mémoire vive  </text>

    almeno per come era stato annunciato e dipinto da partiti e principali mass media nelle scorse
    settimane, ma a giudicare dai ministri confermati o scelti a guidare la nazione in un momento
    così critico, ci troviamo di fronte semplicemente alla solita spartizione di poltrone e ruoli di
    potere a cui gli italiani sono abituati. Oggi l'Italia entra in una nuova fase, che abbiamo
    deciso di chiamare 'mediocrazia'. Mentre imprese e commerciati combattono ogni giorno per tenere
    aperte le proprie attività, sempre in balia delle zone a colori, gli sbarchi continuano senza
    freni. Gli italiani tutti poi, sono abbandonati a sé stessi, a fronte di una sanità al collasso
    e riconfermare ministri come Lamorgese e Speranza è una vera e propria mancanza di rispetto nei
    confronti della nazione. Altro che governo dei migliori: benvenuti nella mediocrazia". </text>

    l'utopie de l'hybridation universelle et à la destruction planétaire de la "blanchité"
    (catéchisme décolonial à base de leucophobie obsessionnelle). Pour paraphraser Joseph de

    racisme en sens contraire. [...]L'indigénisme est assurément une subversion de la société, mais
    absolument pas une subversion du système dominant. La pensée décoloniale fait déjà le jeu du
    Capital en affirmant que les problèmes sociaux ne sont que le paravent des problèmes ethniques.

    symbolique opposée : la chute du Mur de Berlin en 1989 et l’effondrement des Twin Towers le 11
    septembre 2001. Le premier a été considéré dans les milieux libéraux comme marquant la fin des
    totalitarismes et la naissance d’une ère de prospérité et de paix universelle débouchant sur la
    " fin de l’histoire " (Francis Fukuyama). Le second, tout au contraire, a révélé la puissance du
    " fanatisme religieux " faisant irruption dans un monde globalisé cherchant à s’unifier par le
    moyen de la technologie et du commerce. D’un côté, le triomphe de la pensée " rationnelle ", de
    l’autre le spectre des " fous de Dieu ". La théologie politique, du même coup, a repris ses
    droits : au cours de la dernière décennie, des centaines de livres, d’essais, d’articles, de
    colloques sont venus témoigner de son actualité, qu’il s’agisse des efforts déployés par les
    Eglises pour échapper à la privatisation intégrale de la foi et reprendre pied dans l’espace
    public, des débats sur la laïcité et le statut civil des religions, des discussions sur le "
    matérialisme pratique " et le " désenchantement du monde ", mais aussi sur le " retour du

    exercent aujourd’hui une séduction que l’ancienne théologie de la libération des années 1970 et
    1980 a perdue. (…) La question de la pertinence politique du christianisme reste ainsi ouverte,
    tout comme celle d’une éventuelle levée de l’"excommunication" publique de la religion. On peut
    la formuler ainsi : si la modernité a pu être définie en termes de sécularisation, la

    devient-elle au sens strict un problème ? On devine la réponse. Elle le devient à l’interface de
    l’état civil et de l’état de nature : à l’endroit même, autrement dit, où ils se rencontrent et
    se mélangent, deviennent, comme c’est le cas parfois, indémêlables. […] Il se crée ainsi un état
    de choses ambigu, état de choses qui n’est ni exactement l’état civil ni l’état de nature. Ni
    l’état civil, car à partir du moment où l’État ne fait plus ce qu’il est supposé devoir faire
    (et qu’on attend de lui qu’il fasse), assurer la sécurité des citoyens, ces derniers récupèrent
    leurs droits naturels et redeviennent sui juris, libres, donc, de faire ce que bon leur semble.
    Ni non plus l’état de nature, car, bien que n’honorant plus sa part du pacte social, l’État n’a
    pas disparu pour autant. Il ne nous protège plus de rien, en revanche nous suit à la trace, se
    montre très vigilant sur ce que nous faisons, pensons, etc. C’est ce que l’on appelle le
    contrôle social. Plus fondamentalement encore, il continue à revendiquer pour son propre compte
    le monopole de la violence physique légitime, illégitimement, certes, mais il le revendique. Et
    donc, effectivement, l’autodéfense devient ici un problème. Elle ne l’est pas dans l’état civil,
    puisque dans l’état civil le droit à l’autodéfense n’existe pas. Ni davantage dans l’état de
    nature, puisque dans l’état de nature le droit à l’autodéfense n’est contesté par personne. Mais
    ici, oui, il l’est. L’autodéfense est certes ici un droit (à la différence de ce qui se passe
    dans l’état civil), mais (à la différence de ce qui se passe dans l’état de nature) c’est un
    droit contesté. Il l’est en particulier par l’État, qui défend son monopole. En toutes sortes de
    domaines, l’État se montre très tolérant, mais là il se montre intraitable. Toute velléité de
    passage à l’acte est aussitôt et sévèrement sanctionnée. "Éric Werner, "Défense de l’autodéfense

    capitalisme, d’Angus Deaton et Anne Case, éditions PUF.Serait-ce la fin du rêve américain ?
    L’espérance de vie aux États Unis a récemment baissé : du jamais-vu en Occident depuis 1918.
    Durant les deux dernières décennies, le nombre des suicides ou des décès dus à l’alcoolisme et à
    la consommation de drogues n’a cessé d’augmenter. Anne Case et le prix Nobel d’économie Angus
    Deaton ont été les premiers à tirer la sonnette d’alarme face à ce phénomène qui affecte
    principalement la classe ouvrière blanche. Ils dressent dans cet ouvrage le portrait d’une
    Amérique dont le système économique et social conduit à l’enrichissement toujours plus important
    des riches, tandis qu’il abandonne les non-diplômés, autrefois portés par l’American Dream et
    désormais condamnés au désespoir. Les auteurs livrent une analyse puissante de la façon dont les
    excès du capitalisme détruisent les classes populaires américaines et ruinent tous leurs
    espoirs. </text>

  <text date="02.26.2021" source="Zentropa" wordcount="216"> J’apprends avec beaucoup de tristesse,
    et non sans colère, que la police italienne a pris le contrôle et placé sous saisie l’occupation
    de Macarese tenue depuis de nombreuses années par la communauté Fons Perennis qui m’y avait reçu
    – parmi nombre d’autres camarades européens  - à plusieurs reprises avec toute la gentillesse et
    la souriante bienveillance qui caractérisent ses membres. Ce bâtiment, laissé totalement à
    l’abandon par les pouvoirs publics démissionnaires, avait patiemment été reconstruit et restauré
    grâce au travail acharné de la communauté pour devenir peu à peu un lieu accueillant, un lieu
    vivant, un lieu de culture et de solidarité concrète. On y élevait des poules, on y faisait du
    vin, on y organisait des formations, des conférences et des concerts…  Pour le système c’était
    insupportable, il fallait punir un tel crime, mettre un terme à une pareille provocation ! Mieux
    vaut un tas de ruines mangé par les ronces  et les mauvaises herbes qu’une communauté non
    conforme, patriote  et solaire… L’Etat contre le peuple. Une fois encore.Je ne doute pas que
    cette injustice et cette épreuve, qu’ils sauront surmonter, rendront encore  plus forts et
    soudés les membres de cette communauté si méritante. Je leur adresse mes plus sincères, amicales
    et solidaires pensées. En attendant, je l’espère, de pouvoir les aider plus concrètement.Xavier

    toute pratique religieuse, m'écrivait dans une lettre qui m'a été bien précieuse par tant
    d'affection: " Tu te souviens ? Nous parlions parfois de Dieu, et j'avais l'impression que
    chacun de nous était heureux de savoir que l'autre aimait la Vierge et les saintes. Je n'ai pas
    la foi et sans doute refuserai je le prêtre—ils nous ont dégoûté de leur religion—mais chaque
    soir je prie la Vierge pour vous, mes prisonniers, et pour ceux qu'une répression ignoble et
    impie fait abattre dans notre pauvre patrie. " Il me dit aussi: " Quand reviendront des jours
    paisibles, je ne me battrai plus que pour deux choses: le drapeau noir et les copains. Il faudra
    plus que jamais se souvenir de l'ignominie des corps sociaux. " Pour cette dernière phrase, la
    recommandation est inutile. Mais je garde l'autre, le drapeau noir et les copains, comme une de
    mes devises sacrées."Robert Brasillach, Lettre à un soldat de la classe 60. </text>

    qu'ailleurs. Et cela vient peut-être de ce que la fatigue de vivre y est plus grande
    qu'ailleurs, non pour les habituelles ou négligeables raisons matérielles, mais parce que Paris
    ne donne pas la sensation de l'éternité que donne la nature ou que donnent certaines villes,
    comme Athènes ou Rome. La sensation que donne Paris, c'est celle du fugitif, du transitoire, du
    provisoire."Curzio Malaparte </text>
